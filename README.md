# Timed-Quiz

## Description

I wanted to create a timed quiz that I could populate with my own questions to practice! I also wanted to be able to save the scores to local storage and retrieve them. This page is the result! This project was a great springboard for going deeper into javaScript for me, and I learned more about using local storage and navigating arrays.
